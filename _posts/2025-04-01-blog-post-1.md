# Disclaimer

The faculty job search process varies greatly depending on the research area. The insights in this post are specific to those seeking Assistant Professor positions in the U.S., particularly in fields similar to transportation engineering.

## Timeline

I primarily applied to positions at U.S. universities, with a few international applications. Based on my experience, over 90% of U.S. institutions post job openings between September and January, typically for positions starting the following fall. Some universities may post openings as late as March 2025, but those are rare.

Once a position is posted, you typically have a few weeks to a couple of months to submit your materials. If you're fortunate, the university will invite you for a virtual interview. With even more luck, that could lead to an onsite interview, after which the university will decide whether to extend an offer.

Here are some examples of positions I applied to:

1. **Position 1**
   * 10/15/2024 – Job posted (deadline: 12/10/2024)
   * 12/02/2024 – Application submitted
   * 01/31/2025 – Virtual interview
   * 02/12/2025 – Onsite interview
   * 03/04/2025 – Verbal offer received

2. **Position 2**
   * 10/30/2024 – Application submitted
   * 11/25/2024 – Virtual interview; no updates afterward

3. **Position 3**
   * 09/06/2024 – Application submitted
   * 03/25/2025 – Rejection received

4. **Positions 4 – N**
   * Applications submitted; no updates received

As you can see, the process spans several months and requires planning, physical and mental endurance, and **A LOT OF** patience—especially since around 75% of the universities I applied to never provided any updates. 

## Materials

Every university will require several application materials, including a CV, research statement, teaching statement, list of references, and other supporting documents (e.g., diversity statement, leadership statement, transcripts, representative publications, certificates, etc.). This is your first chance to communicate with members of the search committee, with the goal of convincing them that you have the potential to: conduct innovative research, secure external funding, teach courses, mentor students, and contribute to service. These key points should be reflected throughout your materials.

It’s wise to begin preparing these documents as early as you decide to pursue an academic career. I spent a lot of time writing and revising my research statement—something I regret not starting earlier during my PhD. By writing early, you give yourself the chance to align your research activities with your long-term vision. A research statement is not just an application requirement—it serves as a roadmap for your past, current, and future work. Ideally, you start drafting it early and gradually enrich it with results as your research progresses.

1. CV
2. Research statement
3. Teaching statement
4. Letters of recommendation
5. Additional materials (if required):
   * Diversity statement
   * Leadership statement
   * Other supporting documents

## Virtual Interview

Practice answering common questions and make sure your setup is professional—good lighting, clear audio, and a neutral background can go a long way.

## Onsite Interview

Engage actively with faculty and students. Prepare a strong job talk and be ready for in-depth discussions about your research and teaching philosophy.

## Receiving Offers and Negotiation

Review offers carefully. Consider salary, startup funds, teaching load, and other resources that can support your success. Don’t hesitate to negotiate.
