<p>Proactive Traffic Safety Intelligence" refers to a sophisticated and cutting-edge approach to 
analyzing and enhancing traffic safety using advanced technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). 
This concept involves utilizing AI techniques to collect, process, and analyze data related to traffic patterns, 
vehicle behavior, road conditions, and other relevant factors to identify potential safety risks and devise 
effective solutions to mitigate them. The goal is to create a safer and more efficient traffic environment by 
leveraging AI's capabilities to predict, prevent, and respond to traffic incidents and accidents. 
This approach combines data-driven insights, real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and smart decision-making 
to proactively improve the safety of road users and reduce the likelihood of accidents.</p> -->
