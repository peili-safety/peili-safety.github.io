I am a [Scientist](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/cee/Staff/Li_Pei/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research aims to advance **smart mobility** through **digitalization**, focusing on continuous sensing, predictive analysis, and seamless communication. I am interested in understanding how cutting-edge technologies, including digital twins, AI, and vehicle-to-everything, impact transportation, as well as how to leverage them to address existing and emerging challenges in transporation safety and mobility.

I develop theoretical models to understand and predict traffic status and road user behavior by integrating AI, machine learning, and statistical methods with fundamental transportation safety and behavior modeling methods. Moreover, by leveraging digital twins and vehicle-to-everything technoligies, my work bridges digital and physical transportation systems, laying the groundwork for future mobility.

<!-- My CV is available from [here](https://peili-sandman.github.io/files/cv_pei.pdf). -->


<!---
I received my PhD degree in Transportation Engineering under the supervision of [Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Aty](https://www.cece.ucf.edu/aty/). I received my master degree in communication and transportation engineering and bachelor degree in logistics engineering from Tongji University in 2015 and 2018, respectively.
